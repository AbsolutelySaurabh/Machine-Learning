    "## Decision Tree Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression trees are needed when the response variable is numeric or continuous. For example, the predicted price of a consumer good. Thus regression trees are applicable for prediction type of problems as opposed to classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that in either case, the predictors or independent variables may be categorical or numeric. It is the target variable that determines the type of decision tree needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition:\n",
    "In a regression tree the idea is this: since the target variable does not have classes, we fit a regression model to the target variable using each of the independent variables. Then for each independent variable, the data is split at several split points. At each split point, the \"error\" between the predicted value and the actual values is squared to get a \"Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)\". The split point errors across the variables are compared and the variable/point yielding the lowest SSE is chosen as the root node/split point. This process is recursively continued."
